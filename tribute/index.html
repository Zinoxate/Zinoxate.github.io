       <h3>Desmond T. Doss</h3>
       <b>Desmond T. Doss never wanted to kill, but to save. He thought that all types of killing was a simple sin, as he is a christian, so he didnt take part into it. He still did want to join the military though. As a resort, he became a medic for his division. He had armed weapons but he really just "tossed them aside" as if it never did exist. Desmond never killed one man, and he never planned to either during the war. He planned to save all the injured, no matter who or what they are.</b>
